    "description": "Mountains are our first love and after many years we found our resting pad in Mussoorie with Brisa â€˜19; named it as a tribute to the windy region. If you are looking to get away from the hustle, get close to nature and still be within reasonable distance of popular places; the place will suit your palette.Situated on a cliff, views from Brisa '19 will be one of a lifetime. The deck area nearly feels nearly like a Terrace to the city of Dehradun with unobstructed 180 degree views.",
